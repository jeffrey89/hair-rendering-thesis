abstract = {We describe a general investigation into the scattering of light by human hair. The main features of the intensity distribution produced by light scattered by an individual hair are identified. Qualitative explanations for the features are advanced in terms of the arrangement of the outer structure of the hair and its level of pigmentation. Contrast gloss values are calculated in an attempt to quantify the appearance of hair. These values are found to depend not only on the properties of hair, such as color and condition, but also on the direction and polarization state of the incident light. In assessing the effects of cosmetic treatments on hair, gloss values are shown to be useful where readings from treated hairs are compared with those from a control sample investigated in the same conditions.},

The backscattered band of light has a definite width that depends on the ellipticity and relative orientation of the fiber. By observing the width and the shift of the band of backscattered light as a function of fiber orientation the ellipticity of the fiber cross section can be determined with the help of plots given in this paper.},

abstract = {When a dielectric circular cylinder is obliquely illuminated, thescattering angle associated with the Airy caustics of the cylinder'sprimary rainbow depends on the tilt of the cylinder. We displayrecords of the scattering pattern for a transparent poly(methylmethacrylate) fiber ranging from small values of tilt through valuesof tilt that are sufficiently large for the Airy caustics from bothsides of the fiber to merge in a meridional plane containing theincident wave vector and the fiber's axis. The records arecompared directly with the evolution of the caustic projected onto theobservation plane, and certain qualitative features of the globalevolution of the caustics are confirmed. Although the observationsused laser illumination, they are relevant to anticipating thescattering by sunlit transparent tilted cylinders.},

abstract = {We both theoretically and experimentally examine the behavior ofthe first- and the second-order rainbows produced by a normallyilluminated glass rod, which has a nearly elliptical cross section, asit is rotated about its major axis. We decompose the measuredrainbow angle, taken as a function of the rod's rotation angle, into aFourier series and find that the rod's refractive index, averageellipticity, and deviation from ellipticity are encoded primarily inthe m $=$ 0, 2, 3 Fourier coefficients,respectively. We determine these parameters for our glass rod and,where possible, compare them with independent measurements. We findthat the average ellipticity of the rod agrees well with directmeasurements, but that the rod's diameter inferred from the spacing ofthe supernumeraries of the first-order rainbow is significantly largerthan that obtained by direct measurement. We also determine theconditions under which the deviation of falling water droplets from anoblate spheroidal shape permits the first few supernumeraries of thesecond-order rainbow to be observed in a rain shower.},
